## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

+ Honestly? I kind of hated it. I felt like it was severely cutting my flow. I do understand that I need to take more breaks, it's just never really been my style, and I'll need some practice. 25 minutes is WAY too short for me. I need at least an hour. But hey, by trying the Pomodoro technique I learned for certain that I do need longer focus increments but that it's also good to take short breaks more often.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

+ So for this Section 4 of the prework, I just sat down and worked on it over a 24 hour period: two solid work-days of time. My intention was to start Section 4 Wednesday morning and to get done by the end of the day on Thursday (the day I'm writing this). Because I did have life things going on in the midst of Wednesday, my longer breaks were already pre-set. My intentions for Step 1 were simply to get the next part done: objects, methods, properties, class methods, tweet, and now this reflection. Examples: *Step 1:* Do Objects Portion; *Step 1:* Do Methods Portion; *Step 1:* Do Properties Portion. I installed the Marinara extension to Chrome because I had a feeling I wouldn't do so well setting my own timers. I actually kind of felt rushed because I could look in the top right corner of any browser and see a timer, and I'm not sure if that did or didn't help my focus- just made me a bit more agitated. I'm not good with guessing how long things will take yet. The prework for Section 2 estimates that it takes 8-12 hours and that Section 3 takes 6-10. I spent 1 more hour working on Section 3 than 2 which, according to your projections, is backwards. So far Section 4 has taken me the same amount of time as the first three sections, but it's projected to take longer. Still going to need lots more practice and experience in order to properly guess my timing.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

+ Objects and Arrays both store more complex data. However, an Object stores **strings** (which allows you to treat the object like it's a database for storing data and organizing it) whereas Arrays store **ordered lists** of data where each item is accessed using the index of the item.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class: array
  * List of states and their capitals: object
  * List of things to pack for vacation: array
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow: array
  * List of student names and their cohort: object
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake: object
  * All my favorite restaurants: array

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

+ I'm going to use my library app *Libby* as an example, specifically looking at audiobooks.
+ Keys:
  + name of book currently listening to (bookName)
  + length (bookLength)
  + percentage of book completed (completedPercentage)
  + speed of reader (readSpeed)
  + current chapter (chapter)
+ Values (I'll use the real-life current book I'm listening to for the values):
  + bookName = "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"
  + bookLength = "14:21:07"
  + completedPercentage = "78%"
  + readSpeed = "2.00x"
  + chapter = 14

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

+ Hooo boy. I'm getting the sense that there is SO. MUCH. I had a ton of questions about how to do the last two exercises (classMethods.js and tweet.js) but with some help, I was able to work through those. I feel like I don't have any general questions at this time but lots of "How do you do this particular thing?" or "Why when I did this it worked but when I did that which was basically identical it didn't?" I need more and more and more practice to build my skills and to know how to ask questions.
