## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
+ I love the idea that we all have the brainpower, the capacity, to learn a new discipline; the caveat is the ability to implement the right technique in your learning in order to really progress in that discipline.
+ From this list, I’d say I already read quite a bit. I’m working on leaning into the process and having a growth mindset- I can be impatient and learning can be slow. I do really enjoy going through with others and teaching/learning from them, great to see how other brains approach the same information. I 100% am not an early, often, and short break kind of person. I tend to be a nose-to-the-grind, stay-after-it-until-I’m-completely-done kind of person. I don’t think that will work much for this whole Turing process- at least that’s what I’m being told again and again. This is going to be a radical shift from how I normally operate; we shall see how it goes. I also need to sleep more and be more mindful of my diet.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
+ String: a data type that is a sequence of letters/other characters that are all contained within '' or “ ”.
+ Number: a data type that includes all numbers, negatives and decimals included, where no commas are used for larger numbers (ex: 3456 not 3,456)
+ Boolean: a data type that evaluates and results in only TRUE or FALSE; Booleans use comparison operators to determine the TRUE/FALSE. Some examples: <  >  !=  ==  <=  >=

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
+ console.log(“Hello Wold!”)

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
+ Anything that follows two backslashes // will not be run and will be ignored by the JavaScript interpreter.
+ This is also the case with any text written between /*    */  This is a good method for making multiple line comments. Code comments are EXTREMELY useful- for yourself and for others. You use them to explain what your code does or what you'd like it to do. You can also point out places where you might be having issues for others to help out, etc etc.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
+ A variable represents a value that is changeable; it is information that is temporarily stored and used.
+ 5 Year Old Explanation- There are lots of sports people can play- baseball, basketball, tennis, track, volleyball, and football, to name a few. A lot of these sports use balls- the sport of baseball uses baseballs, basketball uses a basketball, tennis uses a tennis ball, and so on. These balls are all different but they are still balls.
If I want to play a game outside with lots of people, where you go to bat and run around bases, I'm wanting to play baseball. If I'm playing this game and I say "Hey, can you throw me the ball?" are you going to throw me a tennis ball? No, you wouldn't. That's because the word ball (the variable) in this instance specifically means baseball.
If I was playing a game where I wanted to bounce the ball and shoot it through a hoop, if I said, "Pass me the ball," you would know that I wanted you to pass me a basketball.
The specific ball (variable) changes with the information given (what game am I playing).

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used?
+ I use my library app Libby all the time. Because I'm automatically logged in, I don't have to reenter the information, but some variables that are stored while I'm logged in are username, email, and password. I also have 3 library cards loaded into the app. These are variables as well- when I make a search for a book, a program has to check each variable to see if that book is available to any of the cards (variables). There are many more, but these are a few.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
+ A concatenation is where strings are joined together using the plus operator (+).

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
+ Google Docs: Near the top of every document there's a line that pops up telling you how long it's been since your last edit. "Last edit was" + var timeSinceLastEdit + " ago". The time is a variable that will change constantly but the words surrounding the time stay the same.
+ A lot of apps/websites will attach your name to a welcome message when you login. "Welcome " + var userFirstName + "!"

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
+ Booleans. I'd like to see these in action and the WHY behind them. I feel like I 'understand' as much as we've been given about them, but I'm curious where/how they are used. I can't yet wrap my head around where they'd be useful.
Additionally, I'm wondering- since we learned interpolation, when/why would people still use concatenations instead of interpolations since interpolations seems more streamlined to me.
