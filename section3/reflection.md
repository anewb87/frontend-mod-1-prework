## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

+ The article stated that *Reflecting on areas of improvement and seeing mistakes as learning opportunities is one of the most difficult growth mindset practices, but programming helps to normalize these behaviors in a productive way.* I really appreciated the reminder that this (making mistakes and seeing where I'm lacking) will become normal. It can be hard to see mistakes as mistakes rather than failures and not take it personally or have your mistakes become tied to your identity in some way. Mistakes are common, normal, constant in programming. They're also a super powerful tool in growing and learning. I know that for me I tend to learn better once I've done something wrong and then take the time to correct myself rather than getting it right the first time around.

+ One of the first principles talked about in the article was about setting S.M.A.R.T. goals- goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound. I'm not going to lie, I'm pretty terrible at this. Don't do the New Years Resolution thing, hardly ever write things down that I'd like to accomplish, don't have a 5 year plan... I've got a lot of work to do when it comes to goals in general and S.M.A.R.T. goals specifically. My goal right now is to get through Turing, learn a ridiculous amount, get a good job. But that's waaaaaay too vague. Having that particular principle be one of the very first is a bit of a wake up call. It's time to get my booty in gear.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

+ I felt that a lot of the principles listed in the article are things I already do, strive to do, or at least are cognizant of something that I should do. I do believe that I can improve my coding skills with effort and practice. This is the first principle listed in the article, and I believe whole-heartedly in it; I wouldn't be here if I didn't.  Striving to improve is another of the principles that I really resonate with. I'm here to challenge myself, and I want to do well and write good code.

+ In the previous question I explained a bit of how I don't demonstrate a Growth Mindset when it comes to goal-making because I don't really do it. I also need to work on swallowing my pride a bit when it comes to not being afraid to ask for help. For me, how I feel about asking (and consequently whether or not I do), tends to be directly correlated to whom I'd be asking. If I have a good friend who can help me out, I don't really have any hangups about asking. If, however, it were a boss or lead teacher or something, it's going to take me a bit to get over myself and make the ask. I still need to divorce myself from the idea that asking a question that I feel I should be able to figure out (but just can't) doesn't make me incompetent or that I'll be seen as a superior as less than. Rather, this is just part of the growing process.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

+ Ebay likely uses lots of Arrays. Each user has a profile *My eBay* that contains lists in these categories: Watching, Saved, Buy Again, Purchases, Bids and Offers, Selling, etc. You add and subtract items from these lists all the time. Some the user does themselves, others (Purchases for example) will be done automatically when the user does something specific (buys an item).

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

+ An Array method is a built-in function in JavaScript that we can apply to Arrays. They are unique and perform a specific change to the Array. Examples we worked on: `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

+ The purpose of a loop is to save time and energy! It's a way to write code for an action but then have the program repeat it `n` number of times. You are able to run the same code over and over again with differing variables.

+ You would use a loop in conjunction with an array when you want to perform an action on each item in a collection (an Array). You'd use a loop in general, not specifically on an array, when you simply want to repeat an action of written code.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

+ When we are hungry, we like to eat. Let's pretend it's snack time, and you are hungry. I have a bunch of grapes. You eat the grapes one at a time. You eat the first grape and are still hungry. You eat a second grape, and you're still hungry. Three grapes, four grapes, five grapes, all the way up to 24 grapes. After each grape, you still want more. But then you eat grape 25. After this grape you decide that you're not hungry anymore, so you stop eating.  
This is a loop. You ate single grapes and decided after each if you were still hungry. If you were, you ate another grape. When you became full, you stopped eating.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

+ When you start to combine them it was pretty tricky. Is there like an 'order of operations'? It seems there must be, but even when I was searching on how to do that last problem in *loops-array.js* people were saying yes you can do something and the next comment would say no you can't. Then others would have it written one 'inside' the other and others were the other way around. My questions for now are really formatting ones- when you want to do conditionals inside an array that you're going to loop (and maybe there are other things that we will learn I'd assume), is there an intuitive way, or a way to yourself figure out how to write the code. ??? Practice and time will tell.
