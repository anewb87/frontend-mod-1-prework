This is where I describe, in my own words what each of the following methods does: `pop`, `push`,`shift`, and `unshift`.
1. `pop`: This method removes the last item in the Array
2. `push`: This method allows you to add an item at the end of an Array
3. `shift`: This method removes the first item in the Array
4. `unshift`: This method allows you to add an item at the beginning of an Array
